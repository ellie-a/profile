        <p>
          I've been in and out of school for the last <em>5 years</em>, bouncing a little back and forth about what exactly I wanted to major in. I ended up in the sciences relem, but with that takes years of schooling and money. I heard about Epicodus and it's intense program leading to a job track, and decided "Why not?". I'm hopping to have it hopefully eventually tie into my overall plan in the sciences and allow me to expand in skills.
